I am a gamer, open source developer, and masculinist.

**I need masculinism because:**
	*Men are discriminated against because of feminist agendas to reverse sexism by unfairly helping women get ahead.
	*Society thinks that men who get raped were weak.
	*"Empowered" women continue to oppress innocent nice guys.
