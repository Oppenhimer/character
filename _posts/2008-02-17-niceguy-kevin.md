title: Looking for a girlfriend for Kevin
---

If there are any single girls out there in the Fredericksburg area looking for a boyfriend, please consider my friend Kevin.  He is shy and has trouble putting himself out there, but he is very open and welcoming and very nice to talk to and can have mature conversations.  I am sure that you would be lucky to have him because **he is a really nice guy**.  I have spent a lot of time with him but I have a boyfriend and I can tell you that you would think that he is a lot of fun.  He can be very mature and talk about complex things.
