title: I just met a really nice guy!
---

I just went on a date with a really nice guy yesterday who was so formal.  I'm glad that feminism hasn't completely killed chivilry in men.  He took care of everything and provided such service like a gentleman.  He gave me a ride and dressed up in a suit and fedora.  It turns out we have a lot in common.  He thinks men should go back to being masculine and women should accept traditional roles while still maintaining rights.  We are going to a Men's Rights protest this weekend.
